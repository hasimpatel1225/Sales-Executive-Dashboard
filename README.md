📊 Sales Executive Dashboard

This is my Excel-based Sales Executive Dashboard, where I worked on raw data cleaning, transformation, and building a clean, interactive dashboard to understand overall sales performance.

The workbook has three sheets:

Raw Data – the original dataset
Cleaned_Data – processed data after removing duplicates, fixing blanks, and formatting
Dashboard – the final visual dashboard with PivotTables, charts, and slicers

🔍 What this dashboard shows:

Total sales overview
Executive-wise performance
Region-wise comparisons
Monthly sales trends
Product-level insights

Fully interactive filters for better analysis

🛠️ Tools & Techniques Used:

Excel PivotTables & PivotCharts
Slicers for dynamic filtering
Data cleaning (formatting, blank handling, duplicates removal)
Dashboard layout & design

This is one of my first complete Excel projects, and I built it to improve my data analysis and dashboard-building skills.
More projects coming soon! 🚀
